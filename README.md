# CostaRicaBlog
Esto es mi proyecto para convirtiendo la clase de Espa√±ol 230 a "honores."

I am studying abroad in Costa Rica for the University of Michigan's Spring term. I am taking Spanish 230:
"Intensive Second-Year Spanish."

As a part of the Honors Program at Michigan, I will be maintaining this blog (completely in spanish) in order to recieve
honors credit for the course.

Pura Vida,

Jared
